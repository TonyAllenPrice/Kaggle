# Kaggle Competition Notebooks by Tony Allen Price

**Kaggle** is a Data Science and Machine Learning competition website that uses a number of publicly availible data sets to design and implement challenges to data scientists. I find the competitions very enjoyable, and love building strong models to address the questions. You can see all of my public competition data here, [Tony's Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/tonyallenprice)

I look forward to adding to these overtime.
